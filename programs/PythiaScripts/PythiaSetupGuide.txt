#Steps to install pythia and run for C3 Hadron Pair Production Background

#Log in to cluster or area with cvmfs
#Download latest version of Pythia (https://www.pythia.org/)
#scp the pythia tar into your cluster and chosen working directory
#Once in working directory on cluster:
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_101/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
tar xvfz pythia8309.tgz #or whatever version of pythia instead of 8309
cd pythia8309 #or other pythia version
./configure –with-hepmc3
gmake
export PYTHIA8DATA=$PWD/share/Pythia8/xmldoc #Very important step!
cd examples
#To make sure installation and setup are correct, do:
make main41
./main41
#Should not throw any errors and output a hepmc file

#In line 73 of the Makefile, add “main69” to the list of examples using hepmc3
#edit main69 to produce hepmc3 output (working on that currently)
